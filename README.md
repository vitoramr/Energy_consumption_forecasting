# Energy consumption forecasting

## Introduction

This repository contains part of the study of my graduation thesis for a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Engineering School of the University of São Paulo (in Portuguese: *Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo*).

The objective of the research is to predict the impact of climate change on the energy consumption of a commercial building through neural networks.

## Methodology

For this study, I am going to train different forecasting models to predict the energy consumption of a hotel from São Paulo given the weather data of the same period.

The weather data used for the study was granted by the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG), collected from the "Estação Meteorológica do IAG/USP".
